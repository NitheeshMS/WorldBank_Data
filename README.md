# WorldBank_Data
In 2006, Hans Rosling gave a TED talk titled The best stats you've ever seen. At the beginning of the talk, he showed an animation he made to debunk some misconceptions about today's world.  I enjoyed seeing this visualisation and reproduced it with the tools I know (i.e. Python, Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn and Matplotlib).
